"""The chart of an activity's page: one of the series its records give (heart rate, elevation,
and pace or speed by its sport; their words in gui/words.py) over the time since its first
record. A value not given and records that stop for a while (a pause) leave a gap in the line;
so does a stop in the pace, never a slow climb. Pace is smoothed over about 30 s of moving and
drawn with the faster on top, its axis from the pace of most of the moving records (a value
beyond it drawn at its edge); the points are brought down to two a pixel column without losing a
peak; the axes have round values. A click, a drag or the keys place a cursor, its value said
beside the switch. The numbers need no screen; the drawing is Cairo in a Gtk.DrawingArea.
Has: no attribute of the window; the chart's widgets keep their series and cursor themselves."""
